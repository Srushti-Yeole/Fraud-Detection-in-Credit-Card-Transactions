## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git https://github.com/Ronak-599/Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application**
```bash
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üìä System Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Feature engineering
   - Data validation
   - Preprocessing
   - Scaling

2. **Model Development**
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Cross-validation
   - Performance metrics
   - Model persistence

3. **Real-time Detection System**
   - REST API endpoints
   - Risk scoring
   - Transaction validation
   - Blocking rules

4. **Monitoring System**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Performance tracking
   - System logging
   - Audit trail

## üîß API Endpoints

### Predict Endpoint
```bash
POST /predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "amount": 1000.0,
    "time_of_day": 14.5,
    "n_transactions": 5
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
    "fraud_probability": 0.15,
    "risk_level": "low",
    "blocked": false,
    "timestamp": "2024-03-21T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## üìà Monitoring Metrics

- Total predictions made
- Fraud detections
- Blocked transactions
- Response times
- Model latency
- System health

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

The system can be configured through environment variables:

- `MODEL_THRESHOLD`: Fraud probability threshold
- `MONITORING_PORT`: Prometheus metrics port
- `MIN_SAMPLES`: Minimum samples for retraining
- `PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD`: Model performance threshold

## üîç Model Performance

- Accuracy: 95%+ on test set
- Balanced handling of fraud cases
- Real-time prediction capability
- Continuous performance monitoring
